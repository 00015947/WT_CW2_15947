    This is a simple Pug template for an Event Planning Application. It includes a form to create new events with fields for date, location, and description. It also displays two lists of events, one for upcoming events and one for past events.

    To use this template, you will need to implement the server-side logic to handle the form submission, retrieve the upcoming and past events, and populate the `upcomingEvents` and `pastEvents` variables in the template.

    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
